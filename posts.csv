After researching and having multiple interviews with students at my school, I have realized that even though a lot of college students want to improve their skills and utilize MOOC platforms like LinkedIn Learning and Lynda, they are not finding a support system to allow them to complete many of the courses they start to take.

As a result, I am currently experimenting with the idea of creating a LinkedIn group for my school which would serve as a sort of book club but for LinkedIn Learning courses.

This group would allow students to give honest feedback on courses they have taken to other students, allow them to ask questions regarding particular course instructors and recommendations. The community would also serve as a platform for people to discuss what they have studied in the various courses.

This all is in an effort to get students to not only enrol in courses but to complete them.

I would really appreciate questions, comments or feedback from the cohort before I publish a manifesto for the group and publicize this idea. 

Here is the first iteration of the group :  https://lnkd.in/eSA6Thu

For day 73, in an effort to sharpen my SQL(MySql) skills, I finally completed the SQL challenges on HackerRank and here are some of the things I observed:

1. Understanding the problem is 80% of the solution. I finally realized why I got a lot of my HackerRank challenges wrong. I was too hasty trying to solve the problems instead of fully understanding them. Most of the time my test cases didn't pass, it wasn't because my syntax was wrong or I didn't know SQL commands, but because I was not answering the question.

2. When I solve HackerRank challenges for fun and not for interview preparations or to put on my resume, the challenges become really interesting. Without a time limit, I was able to think critically and approach the problems from various angles, get them wrong, keep trying different approaches until they got solved. 

3. SQL queries have a lot to do with intuition. Instead of memorizing the definitions of the various joins and special commands, I realized that the more I practised, the more I got a sense of what to do when I encountered more difficult problems. In a sense, practice makes perfect.

I have been travelling for most of today so I didn't get a chance to follow my planned learning schedule as usual. 
However, I believe you can learn through passive mediums like music as well. 

While travelling I encountered the song ""Pioneer"" by the band Perry and I have been playing it non-stop because of how touching the lyrics are to me.

Here are some of my favourite lyrics from it:

1. ""Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way.""

2. ""Pioneer, your work is hard, But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart.""

3. ""I won't rest where arms embrace me.""

4. ""I will love when people hate me.""

5.""I won't hush, no you can't make me.""

6. ""Send the dark but it won't break me.""

_
You either create and breed positivity or you don't. 

You're either elevating others, or you're not. 

You're either listening to see what you can give or shutting your ears and living in your privilege. 

It's not a matter of positivity or prosperity preaching. 

""Focus your attention on possibility rather than problem-solving."" - Peter Block, Community: The Structure of Belonging 

People lead because they want to create and unlock possibilities.

Thinking of the world as a set of problems to be solved only perpetuates a cycle of temporary fixes and patchwork solves. 

Leaders lead to bring people together to unlock possibilities with their gifts. 

Communities or complex adaptive coalitions as Thomas Friedman poses thrive when we expose people to opportunities that leverage their gifts and hone in on what's possible. 

That's a different type of mindset. 

Although we are living in complex times, you have to make clear and articulated decisions on what you represent, who you are, and why you lead.

I recently started taking the Enki iOS app seriously. The Enki app is a quick and easy way to keep abreast with software engineering skills with curriculums that range from web development, Python, Git, SQL, to Security and Blockchain. The app lets you complete ~6-minute ""workouts"" on a daily basis and can be really helpful if you need a quick review of basic concepts.

The short notes, exercises, and games do a great job of reinforcing learned concepts. I think I might start adding it to my daily morning routine.

I am not very good at web technologies so I found the JavaScript curriculum and Web curriculum really useful.

After a lot of long hours, I am glad to have completed the Applied Data Science Capstone course which allowed me to finish both the IBM Data Science Professional certificate and the Applied Data Science Specialization.

Thanks to IBM for taking me on this insane and fun journey in exploring data science. I got the chance to work with Data Science and ML tools, Python, SQL, data analysis and visualization and so much more. After 13 courses total, I think IBM Cloud is currently my favorite Cloud platform. I love Cognitive labs, which is an amazing free resource allows you to put what you learn to practice on the cloud.

As a computer science student, sometimes I used to put a lot of unnecessary pressures on myself. I used to think that I need to get the best of grades, know multiple programming languages, win hackathons, know everything about the latest emerging technologies, network, build projects, know all the solutions to Hackerrank and leet code problems, memorize the ""Cracking the coding interview"" cover to cover, Create the next big app, etc, etc.

This checklist of things made me forget why I loved technology in the first place and made me focus on what I can do to get a job at a company instead of what I can do to be a better technologist.

This ""Why you should make useless things"" Ted Talk by the Youtube roboticist, Simone Giertz exemplifies my thoughts right now. 

Currently, I am learning about things that interest me. I am also building and experimenting with technology and basically doing everything on my checklist but this time, I am doing all of that without performance anxiety or the need to prove that I am worthwhile. I am doing them because I love technology and I will always love technology.

I finally got the chance to complete my IBM Applied Data Science capstone project. For my project, I wanted to work on something that was important to me so I worked with 20 of my favorite site attractions in Ghana using data science modules, the Folium API and the FourSquare API to build a Ghana Tourism project in Cognitive Class AI labs. 

I also tried my hands on K-Means clustering but since my data was too little, it didn't really work out.

This project furthered my understanding of APIs and their importance to developers. It also got me reading a lot of documentation but most importantly, it got me to work with IBM cloud which is now officially my favorite cloud provider right now. I might go back to GCP but right now IBM Cloud is what I am using for my projects.

NB: I am still looking at ways to make images appear in Folium pop-ups. If anyone has any suggestions or help please let me know.

To be honest, I am not really a fan of podcasts but since I have become obsessed with the story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, I couldn't pass up this amazing opportunity to hear another dimension to this story through ABC New's Apple podcast ""The Dropout"".

More insights:

1. I still find it funny that an industry that prides itself of the smart people in it, (ask anyone who works in tech why they love their job and they all will in some way or fashion talk about the smart people they get to work with), got bamboozled by, in my opinion, a simple con job.

2. I know I am supposed to hate what Elizabeth did but I must admit, there are traits in the story of young Elizabeth that I find shockingly inspiring. In fact, I believe she exhibited the exact traits that Steve Jobs and young Bill Gates did.

3. It's amazing how a person can use privilege to gain such unbridled access to capital and resources for something like Theranos while others can hardly get any sort of funding.

4. The most important thought for me was, is Theranos feasible with today's technology? I could be wrong on this but I think Theranos was ahead of its time and someone might create a version later on.

This has been one of the most intriguing, difficult and fun courses I have had in a while. The labs are the best and I have even saved them locally just so I can go over them.

What I learned:

1. . The most important part of a data science project is not the code and the fancy things you were able to do with but the story you are able to tell with your data.

2. I still can't seem to figure out the hashtag#Python Geocoder API. If anyone has great resources on it please let me know. It's been a struggle. In fact, I had to use the pypostalcode API just to do my assignment.

3. I signed up for the foursquare API and I used the folium API and I am in love with them. They almost convinced me to try to build a full stack app with a navigation system.

4. For my final project, I am trying to build a map of the tourist sites in Ghana and hopefully with a kind of recommendation system which might take a while and I learned so much about beautiful places in Ghana.

5. Documentation is key for any data science project.

Thank you so much Tim for starting the 365 days of learning challenge. It has become a pivotal point in my professional and academic life. It started out as a way to document my exploration of technology in my final semester of college but it has evolved in to so much more for me. 

Through the challenge, I have read a novel, I have done labs for data science, I have experimented with all the 4 major cloud platforms, I encountered the poetry of Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou, interviewed one of the people I admire, learned from the GRE, and so much more. 

As a result, I have grown my love of learning, interacted with other people on their own learning journeys, learned how to organize my time effectively and learned how to take initiative for myself and accomplish goals I set for myself.

The most important thing I have learned in this process, however, is that I am good enough. The continuous learning has abated feelings of imposter syndrome in technology. 

Now I know that I can exist and thrive in technology and my inability to answer some particular question in an interview does not negate my passion or love of technology.

I have recently been intrigued by large scale software projects and object-oriented programming. So this course was an excellent choice. It is part of the Master Python for Data Science Learning path on LinkedIn Learning but even if you're not interested in data science, it is still a great resource to learn about object-oriented analysis and design with any OO languages including Python.

In addition, I think it is a great resource for technical program management and it employs OO design patterns and principles that are essential to understand how to bring a large scale project to existence.

I used to hate the theory of OO but after this course, I am able to understand the 4 main pillars without having to memorize them and see why OOP is more preferred to functional programming.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-acheampong/,Post,"What I learned about building products from being in a dance team:

1. Technical skills can be taught but passion can't be and great products, like great dance pieces, require people with a lot of passion.

2. Teamwork is essential to great products. No matter how good a performer is, if they don't integrate well with our team, the entire dance looks off. 

3. Even though it might not seem like it, as a dance team, we use a lot of agile processes when creating our pieces. There is a lot of small increments and iteration when creating pieces. 

4. Feedback is a gift. As dancers, we receive instant feedback when we are on stage from the audience and that allows us to modify our pieces to do better at next performances.

5. Planning is essential. Before we even begin practice, we research how we want our dances to be and build a roadmap to accomplish it.

6. Leadership sets the tone for the team. We were fortunate to have great leaders who kept the team on task and inspired the team to flourish and do our very best.


Special shoutout for the ASA Dance team at Berea College Wendy Quanon and Raymond Okyere-Forson for creating such great pieces.

I have been watching Google I/O, Apple Special Events, Apple WWDC, E3 conference, and Samsung Galaxy Unpacked for years. These conferences excite me the way sports events like March Madness, Superbowl, etc. excite some sports fans. For me these announcements are not a way to covet new devices or applications, they are a way for me to see where the landscape of technology is heading and how best as a technologist I can prepare myself to engage with the technology of the future.

For day 57, I got to watch the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2019. I was really excited to see where the galaxy mobile phones are headed especially since it was the 10 year anniversary of the Galaxy flagship phone.

From the event, I have come to the conclusion that AI is here to stay and I better get used to it and I need to learn AR/VR because it seems that is where mobile phone app development is headed.

Unfortunately, I was hoping to see some melanin on the stage but...you know...maybe next year.

I have been trying to delve more into Python data science modules to figure out how they have been architected because I love seeing what makes them work sometimes even more than what I can do with them. 

My search got me to this resource called The Architecture of Open Source Applications. This website(which does not have HTTPS) is an amazing resource that gives the history and the software architecture of some of the most widely used OSS including Git, SQLAlchemy and even Firefox Release Engineering. Unlike reading code in Github repos, this resource gives a lot more background to the thought process that might have went into and some implementations.

For day 56, I read up on the matplotlib library architecture for Python. I learned about the history and how of the 3 possible layers it has, I have only been using the Scripting layer(pyplot). I feel as if I am learning matplotlib for the first time and I am also understanding so much of what goes into building a software architecture that can be used and understood by multiple people. This reading solidified my interest in Python even more.

I think I have found something in tech that I genuinely enjoy. No matter what other things get my attention, I always seem to keep coming back to data. 

I know there are so many cool things to do in full stack web development and building apps but data is what I truly love and enjoy doing. Almost all my CS projects are in Jupyter notebooks, I try to even run my HTML code in Jupyter notebooks.

I really like the Google Cloud Platform but this specialization is really pulling me towards IBM cloud. Like I said in a previous post, I was sleeping on IBM Cloud. It has so many free resources that make learning and exploring data science particularly efficient for college students. Plus this specialization has one of the best SQL courses online I have come across online.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-acheampong/,Post,"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win”

At a really low point last year, I had a heart-to-heart conversation with one of my mentors who told me ""sometimes people won't see your worth that doesn't mean you are not worthy."" That conversation helped me through some really tough times of self-doubt. 

I was under the impression that hard work paid off in success but all my hard work was not yielding any success and I was a bit discouraged.

This is why I relate so much to the story of the AirPods. A lot of people couldn't see their value at the beginning but the tides have turned now and as an article on the Guardian stated, they moved from mockery to millennial status symbol.

Imagine if Apple had pulled the AirPods of the shelf after the first negative reviews and responses, then the world would have missed out on the phenomenon it has turned out to be.

So now I have realized, I should be more interested in building than in receiving validation. I now view hard work as a seed, some take years to fully grow and bear results, others take months.
Neither is better or worse but one thing they have in common is diligent labor.

Special shoutouts to Hina, who sent me on the course to find a great SQL MOOC. I think I might have found one, which might not be the most conclusive but I think it hits on the main topics particularly on relational databases.

Databases and SQL for Data Science by IBM on Coursera is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization, however, it has optional material that delves into the essentials of Databases and SQL.

I am currently having some trouble with the final peer review assignment but I am working on it and hoping to get it right.

In addition, what I found really helpful for applying what I learned in that course was by writing queries in HackerRank's SQL challenges.

A friend recommended I download the Get Wired app on my iPhone and read it in addition to the Morning Brew every morning and I must say that the app is a really great way to keep up with the news in the technology industry.

The sections include Business, Culture, Gear, Ideas, Science, Security, Transportation and BackChannel. The main page has top articles that are regularly updated. 

Today I read an article called, ""The Pentagon needs to woo AI experts away from Big Tech"". The article is really insightful adding another layer to the battle for talent in the technology industry. It even called Big Tech, G-MAFIA and analyzed how difficult it would be for the Government to acquire AI talent in this current climate.

I am currently working on the Master Python for Data Science learning path on LinkedIn Learning and this is the first course in the path.  

Even though it doesn't introduce programming concepts, it does a good job of introducing Python to people who already have knowledge of a programming language like JavaScript and want to transition to Python or people who need to brush up on their Python skills.

The exercise files are great and it is the first course where I have seen a beneficial use of the Q&A feature on LinkedIn Learning.

I didn't really like the discussion on the Python's Datetime and calendar modules because I think they are super-specific and they might not be used frequently.

The course discusses classes excellently and my favorite part of it was the module that scraped online data on Python.

I really think LinkedIn Learning should introduce sandboxes for coding on the platform so people can do exercises online without having to leave.

So I just realized that I have been sleeping on IBM cloud. Even though I have been doing courses and experimenting with CognitiveClass, I never fully utilized all the free resources IBM makes available for learning Data Science until I took the Open Source tools for Data Science course on Coursera. 

So I have been using Jupyter Notebooks exclusively since my sophomore year in college but this course introduced me to Apache Zeppelin which is awesome because it allows data visualizations without code, and it can run Python and R. It also got me to experiment with the RStudio IDE but most importantly it introduced me to the IBM Data Science Experience, which is amazing.

You should check these resources if you are interested in exploring Data Science.

For day 50, I watched one of my inspirations, Marques Brownlee interview Bill Gates which led me to read the Gates Annual letter.

Here are my favorite surprises from the letter:

1. Africa is the youngest continent: 
As a person from Kumasi, Ghana it makes me so happy that the paper stated that Africa ""could double its share of the global labor force by 2050"".

2. Data can be sexist: I used to think data beats opinions but I guess data can be influenced by opinions.

3. Textbooks are becoming obsolete. As a person who loves MOOCs, I have realized that information is growing at such a fast rate that textbooks need to be constantly updated in order to be relevant which is very hard to implement.

I am really glad Amazon Web Services (AWS) decided to put content on Coursera. I might be biased but I think the content creators on Coursera did a really good job. In my opinion, I think they took inspiration from Google Cloud Platform and IBM on Coursera and created a course that is much better than those on AWS Educate. My only qualm is that there are no integrated Qwiklabs. This is important because it is one of the unique differentiation points for Coursera in a sea of MOOCs.

Other than that, the instructors did a really good job of giving a basic understanding of AWS. I already have a Free Tier AWS account so I could follow along with the demos but in the next course, I would love to see integrated Qwiklabs. 

If you want a basic understanding of cloud technology with AWS, this might just be the course for you.

Also, I have been experimenting and playing around with cloud technology and I am genuinely curious to know what people think about the various platforms. Personally, I favor GCP because it is the one I am most familiar with and experimented with the most. For other professionals and students, what is your favorite cloud platform?

Your internship interview is make or break. 

How you perform will determine whether or not you get the internship offer. 

I know a few students that dread on-site interviews.

They feel like they suck at behavioral questions, won't be prepared for unexpected questions, or won't be seen as a culture ""fit"". 

Don't focus on being a culture ""fit."" 
Focus on being a culture ADD. 

Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. 

Before your on-site interview go deep on the company you'll be interviewing with, understand everything about them:

1. Understand their product/service (e.g., what they offer)

2. Understand their brand (e.g., what they stand for/represent and why) 

3. Develop a solid grasp of their market ( e.g., who they compete with and how they compare.)  

Going into the on-site interview, create a set list of stories that highlight your most significant achievements and map to the job description for your internship. 

Think of it as a storybook.📖

Also, treat the interview as a conversation! 

Don't be afraid to ask your interviewer the tough questions!

The interview is an opportunity for you to have your most burning questions addressed and to express what your goals are for the internship.

Preparation is key!

I have been developing an affinity for poetry. I used to not like that form of literature but after reading more and more of it, I am beginning to appreciate the beauty of it.

For day 46, I read the works of Langston Hughes on PoemHunter and below are some of my favorite pieces.

1. Dreams

Hold fast to dreams
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.
Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow.


2. I continue to dream

I take my dreams and make of them a bronze vase
and a round fountain with a beautiful statue in its center.
And a song with a broken heart and I ask you:
Do you understand my dreams?
Sometimes you say you do,
And sometimes you say you don't.
Either way it doesn't matter.
I continue to dream.


3. Still Here

been scarred and battered.
My hopes the wind done scattered.
Snow has friz me,
Sun has baked me,
Looks like between 'em they done
Tried to make me
Stop laughin', stop lovin', stop livin'-
But I don't care!
I'm still here!

For day 45, I got the opportunity to take my first attempt at the GRE and here are the things I learned.

1. My professor said the best preparation for the GRE is the 4 years you spent in school and she was absolutely right. Most of the words I memorized in a few months from flash cards didn't even show up on the test but I found that I could rely on the skill sets I have built over the 4 years I have spent in college more than on the test skills I had memorized.

2. A little anxiety can mean that you care enough about something but too much anxiety can be damaging to your performance.

3. Sometimes you have to trust your intuition. You have to have faith that you've put in the work and done your best and not discredit what you feel or think it's right.

4. Rest is important. In the pursuit of excellence, it is possible that you can overwork yourself and not perform at your maximum best when you actually need to so rest is important.

5. You're not always going to get what you think you deserve. Sometimes you might fall short of your expectations and desires. Those times are not meant for wallowing in self-pity. They are times to reassess, restrategize, get back up and try again.

For day 44, in preparation for the AI For Everyone Coursera course by Andrew Ng this year, I read the AI Transformation Playbook article by Andrew. 

As a young technologist exploring AI and ML, even though I understand some of the theories, research, modules, and mathematics of AI, I sometimes struggle to see a fast industrial AI application for a current software engineering team or how AI can be integrated into current Software teams or companies that might benefit from it but are not necessarily AI specific.

This article addresses those questions by discussing how an enterprise can be transformed with AI in these 5 steps:
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external communications

And who else is better suited to explain this than Andrew with all his experiences from Google Brain, Baidu’s AI Group, and Landing AI.

This article has made me even more excited for the upcoming AI For Everyone course on Coursera. I have already signed up and can't wait to learn.

I have been exploring Stanford online for a while now and I think anyone who loves learning should add it to their resources. There are paid and free courses but I only signed up for the free courses because I am only a college student and I don't have coin like that.

Being an avid user of Coursera, I am always a little biased and tend to compare MOOCs to Coursera. However, one thing is becoming clear, education is being revolutionized and becoming more accessible and equitable. The notion that only certain schools have smart students is eroding and being replaced with the ideology that anyone who is able and willing can learn anything.

The Computer Science 101 and How to Learn Math: For Students are very good courses on the platform.

For day 42, I decided to learn something I had absolutely no idea about. I took the nano@stanford course which deals with nanofabrication and nanocharacterization tools and facilities. I got the chance to see how researchers work in labs and the diligence and precision it takes to be a researcher in the nanotechnology world.

But what is not okay is for you to not see your own vision and your goals and definitely not okay for you to not invest in your own self and this is why I love self-learning.

Self-learning for me personally is simply an attitude and determination to invest in yourself. Realizing who you are and who you aspire to be and working to make these two, one and the same is what self-learning means to me.

It's not about the resources you use or how much time you are able to spend, but it's the mentality that I want to be a better version of myself and I am willing to take advantage of the resources that surround me to do so.

It's not about doing it for recognition, or to impress people or even advance your career. But it's for the feeling of knowing something for yourself and applying it. 

Every time you learn something you add value to yourself, that value may not necessarily be converted to currency immediately, but it will definitely be useful to your growth and development.

As my grandfather used to say, knowledge is power and the pursuit of it is excellence.

Nathan Jose is a junior computer science and music student, my boss at my job on campus and one of the people I respect and hold in high esteem. His work ethic is infectious and I am so glad I get the opportunity to work with him.

One of the things I find incredibly fascinating about Nathan is his passion for music. I consider myself passionate about learning but I have to admit I cannot anyway match his passion for music. 

For day 41, I got the opportunity to actually sit down with him even with his busy schedule and talk about how passion affects our lives.


In our discussions, I learned that passion starts small and grows with constant consistency. Nathan didn't play the guitar because he was good at it, he became good at it because he played. 

Our discussion has inspired me a lot to treat my work in engineering and learning as a piece of art and a way I contribute to society. It also challenged me to go next level with ambitions but most importantly, our discussion re-emphasized the value of good old hard work. 

If I ever get to bring half the passion and enthusiasm of Nathan, I am sure I will only ever produce excellent work.

For day 40, before diving into to the mechanics of the book, I began reading the Life of Isaac Newton from my February book of the math, the English translation of Principia Mathematica .

The story is one that displays of the triumph and excelling of the human spirit even through adversity or prosperity.

The piece discusses his early years, starting from how Isaac was born prematurely to a single mother, to how he exhibited no special talents and was very much disinterested in studies.

His story, which many young kids might relate to essentially changes when he is bullied in school which leads him to ""take to his books"". This experience caused his true personality to show.

Through reading about his life, I realized that being an introvert has it's perks, in a world where we are all expected to be outgoing and taking up mantles to solve problems, there are ways in which those of us who are introverted can contribute to society without caving to the pressures of changing our personality.

The most important lesson I took from reading about his life is ""see a need, fill a need."" Isaac was great because he was always learning and finding ways to solve problems.

Fast forward to college where I forgot my love of learning for the sake of learning and had a really tough time in Computer Science until Marcellus Pelcher introduced me to Coursera which impacted my academic life heavily and reignited my love of learning.

Here are some of the tips I use for keeping that passion alive:

1. I treat all my online courses as part of my formal education. I don't think of them as supplementing my college education. I make time for them just like I do my college classes adding things like homework and labs to my schedule.

2. I implement ingenious ways to learn these courses. For example, I use my Oculus Go to learn courses online.

3. I have great accountability partners and friends who are always encouraging each other and motivating each other to learn.

4. Mixing up my learning to ensure that I am never bored. In addition to courses, I structure my curriculum to include poetry, novels, TED talks, and papers. 

5. The more I do it, the easier it becomes. In a sense, practice makes perfect.

So I have been lurking on the Kaggle website for about 3 months now. Basically observing the competitions, datasets, looking at other people's Jupyter notebooks and seeing how different people approach problems with different solutions. My favorite part of Kaggle however, is the learn tab which offers free online courses in Python, ML, Deep Learning, Data Visualizations etc.

For day 38, I polished up on my SQL skills for a project I am currently working on with the SQL course of Kaggle Learn which is about 3 hours long. What I liked is that the course integrated BigQuery into it and since I have been experimenting with GCP and BigQuery, I found it really helpful. I really enjoyed the lab like exercises to put what I learn to immediate practice. My only qualms are that the course has a lot of reading (I prefer videos) but most importantly, the course is from a data science, big data perspective and so if you want a pure SQL education, it might not be as conclusive.

For day 37, I got the opportunity to hear one of my math professors present on ""dNA: de Bruijn and Nucleotide Assembly."" The presentation included graphs, types of graphs, Konigsberg's Bridge problem, de Bruijn sequences and their application in strings and DNA sequencing.

During this presentation I kept thinking that since Neural Networks are unidirectional graphs could de Bruijn sequences be applied to them. In other words instead of algorithms like the forward propagation and the backward propagation, could the nodes in a neural network be trained in a de Bruijn sequence?

This might be absolutely absurd but I Googled it and found papers that might address my question, ""de Bruijn cycles for neural decoding"" and ""Learning Large DeBruijn Automata with Feed-Forward Neural Networks.""

I am actually curious about this topic now and can't wait to read these papers.

If anyone knows of any resources on de Bruijn cycles and neural networks be it papers, research information, GitHub repos, videos, conferences, presentations, etc. I would love to receive them.

Again if anyone has any ideas or thinks my question bogus please let me know.

As a young man who had just graduated from high school, this was a different environment than I was used to.

This experience didn’t move my academic ambitions but it taught me valuable lessons that I would never have learned any other way.

Below are a few:

1. There’s dignity in all labor. In school, we were made to believe that only certain careers were worth pursuing but being in the real world made me realize that all careers are necessary.

2. Don’t take things too personally. I got the chance to interact with a lot of people, some meaner than others. This made me look at positive and negative comments objectively.

3. Ability to learn on the go is essential in the real world. I couldn’t use any of the things I learned in school so I had to relearn quickly.

4. Things are hard before they become easy. New environments or situations will take some getting used to.

5. Resilience is a skill acquired by experiencing failure and bouncing back over and over again.

My book for the month of February (I know I am a few days ahead) is Andrew Motte's English translation of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica. I have always wanted to read this book but my classes and school work never permitted me to. Now that I have some time on my hand, I have decided to read it.

This book is a math book and it's a dense read which will take up all my time. However, I think reading a lot of math and computer science papers have at least prepared me a little and given me some understanding of what to expect.

I am expecting this book to be difficult to read and understand but I want to at least try, even if I can't complete it. I really hope this book will stir up my interest in math and since it's not for a grade, I can focus on it and try things without fear.

I am going to be visiting my math professors a lot and asking a lot of questions and help.

For day 34, I began reading the life of Isaac Newton which is a part of the beginning of the book and one of the most important lessons I am learning is that its okay to have multiple interests.

This course does a tremendous job of providing objectivity in how big data and data science should be viewed. It debunks some of the myths about big data and gives a wholesome representation of what big data is and if it should be of interest to you.

The course is targeted mostly to industry personnel who are currently using or on the brink of using big data technologies. But I think, if you are student and want to know if big data is worth your while, it is a great start.

What I have learned from my first 30 days  of hashtag#365daysoflearning:

1. Learning for oneself is so empowering. The feeling you get when you learn because you want to learn and not for a job or an interview or to impress anyone is so satisfying. 

2. Documenting your process whether publicly or privately is essential. It's not a means to brag but a way to keep track of your progress, attract like-minded people to your circle and is a really great way to show and keep accountability.

3. Constant consistency is key. The more you learn, the more you'll love to learn. The more you learn, the easier it becomes to learn new things.

4. MOOCs are here to stay. For a long time, the Educational Tech space has not really been very attractive to investors or VCs. However, with all its problems, there is no denying the democratization and impact of MOOCs.

5. Having a community of people who love learning around you keeps you motivated even for the days you don't feel like it. 

6. Last but certainly, learning inspires action. The more you know the more effective you become in putting things into action. I have been working on a lot of projects which were inspired by my learning journey.

One thing that I have personally observed is that when I use HackerRank because I want to and not to prepare for technical interviews or to solve technical interviews, I actually learn a lot about problem-solving. I don't have to worry about memorizing brute force formulae and other people's solutions but I can explore various ways of solving the problem and the best thing is there is no time limit that might inhibit your thinking process. So I think all code newbies should sign up for HackerRank and add it to your study routine, it is really helpful not only for interviews but for exploring various aspects of CS

https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-acheampong/,Post,"Review - Bad Blood by John Carreyrou

Title: The title for this book works on so many levels. Personally, I relate the title to the bad blood between the characters in the book.

Favorite Quote: “What do you want to do when you grow up?” … “I want to be a billionaire.” … “Wouldn’t you rather be president?” … “No, the president will marry me because I’ll have a billion dollars.”

John does a great job of giving some background story on all the characters he presents in the novel to give context to their actions or inactions. However, there were too many background stories that at a point they overshadowed the main story.

Personal Thoughts:
1. I think the idea of Theranos was way ahead of its time. It might have been more plausible with ML and AI.

2. It was really sad to realize that Elizabeth might have changed the tone of her voice to be taken seriously.

3. I found it really funny to see how easy it is to dupe the tech industry. All you have to do is go to a fancy school, have a few rich people back you and everyone will assume you know what you're doing.

Verdict: This book was a great way to start my goal of reading 12 books this year. I highly recommend it.

For day 27 I played around with an AI experiment on the Experiment with Google Website called Teachable machine. This resource is a great and very fun way to understand machine learning particularly deep learning and neural networks. It allows you to use your camera as an input, train your model and gives you an option to choose an output between GIFs, Sound and Speech. You can choose your own outputs and best of all there's no coding involved. You should definitely try it out.

PS: You can submit your own experiments on the Experiment with Google website which I hope to do sometime in the very near future. There are experiments that cover a wide variety of Google technologies like AI, Android, Chrome, VR, AR among others. There are links to Github repos of these experiments and it is just a really fun website.

One of my favorite quotes of all time is ""I go forth
along, and stand as ten thousand"" by Maya Angelou. I just realized it was from her poem ""Our Grandmothers"" and so for day 26, I decided to read it and it is one of the most powerful pieces of literature I have ever encountered.

Favorite Quotes:
1. ""I go forth along, and stand as ten thousand""

2. "" I shall not, I shall not be moved. ""

3. ""You have tried to destroy me and though I perish daily, I shall not be moved.""

4. ""My description cannot fit your tongue, for I have a certain way of being in this world.""

5. ""When you learn, teach. When you get, give.""

6. ""However, I am perceived and deceived, however, my ignorance and conceits, lay aside your fears that I will be undone, for I shall not be moved.""

I knew the possibility of accomplishing this was incredibly slim but I had nothing to lose and a lot to gain so I decided to pursue it. As a result, I began exploring various things, I read books and implemented the code in them on my computer, pursued technical courses online and implemented code in them, I solved HackerRank challenges, pursued personal projects, wrote a whole lot of Jupyter notebook code, etc.

I recently decided to check how many lines of code I had so far since I am about to graduate and realized I had crossed 300,000 lines. As they say, shoot for the moon and even if you miss at least you will land among the stars.

Here's What I learned:
1. Break big goals into smaller accomplishable tasks and achieve them little by little.

2. Constant consistency is key.

3. You might not become good at something after spending a lot of time with it but at least you'll begin to tolerate it if not like it.

Hopefully, I get to 1 million at some point in the future.

Dear LinkedIn Learning,

I am slowly enjoying the more technical courses on the platform. I used to always enjoy the courses on soft skills but recently I think your technical skills content goes hard. As a frequent user of the platform, these are some of my thoughts.

1. I really appreciate the learning paths which I am more used to. I know there are currently like 95 learning paths but I would really appreciate more.

2. I wish the technical courses had sandboxes or virtual labs to do the exercises in. I know I can download the exercise files and do them on my local machine but this is an extra step that is avoided on other MOOC platforms.

3. I would really love it if it were possible to add notes and highlight the transcript. I have a notebook for my MOOCs where I make notes but if I could do it online and specify points I want to get back to, that would be dope.

4. I don't know if it is a content issue or an algorithm issue but every question in the quizzes that has ""all the above"" as an answer, usually is the answer.

5. I also think the certificates need to be redesigned. I barely see people share their certificates like with other MOOCs, only their courses.

I dedicated today to reading my book for January, Bad blood by John Carreyrou. I am going to give a full review when I am done but so far, I am blown away by this story. I sincerely think Netflix or HBO should really consider making a mini-series with this story.

What I have learned so far without giving too much away:
1. There's always more to a story than what is portrayed. I went into the book expecting to hate Elizabeth Holmes but I am realizing that the story is more complex than I thought.

2. Even smart people get things wrong sometimes.

3. The hiring process in tech is not as objective and non-biased as some would like to believe.

4. The success some people experience is only because they are privileged enough to have access to things most people don't have.

5. If there is ever a time you have to choose between integrity and success, money or fame. Always choose integrity. Without it, you might lose all that you have.

If you are interested in the behind the scenes of the start up industry or want to become an entrepreneur please read this book.

For day 22, I finally completed the Stanford online Computer Science 101 course. It is a really great course for people with no prior CS knowledge who want to begin learning or for anyone with knowledge who just wants to brush up on the basics. It is not really meant to teach you a particular programming language, just the basics of CS as a whole and how to think like a Computer Scientist. It uses some variation of JavaScript for the coding lessons but you still need an actual JavaScript course to really understand JavaScript.

It is really basic and allows anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals of CS in a really easy manner.

For day 21, I read ""Learnability can be undecidable"" by  Shai Ben-David, Pavel Hrubeš, Shay Moran, Amir Shpilka & Amir Yehudayoff. 

I found it while I was reading an article on  Science Alert, ""Mathematicians Have Developed a Computing Problem That AI Can Never Solve."" 

The paper tries to show that some solutions to the ‘estimating the maximum’ problem are equivalent to the continuum hypothesis and cannot be proved nor refuted.

I am currently working on a couple of projects that require advanced use of Jupyter notebooks and so for day 20, I decided to learn some cool tricks to do in Jupyter notebooks. I will share my findings later on.

Some of the things I found include:

1. It is possible to run bash scripts in hashtag#Jupyternotebooks, as a result, which means I can work almost exclusively in my notebook. I am yet to push to GitHub from my notebooks.

2. It is possible to inculcate videos in your notebooks. I have previously added static images and GIFs to my notebooks but videos were new to me.

3. I knew about publishing static Jupyter notebooks on websites, I didn't realize you could publish responsive notebooks.

4. It is possible to run R scripts and Python Scripts in the same notebook. My mind was blown.

5. You can write functions in other languages.

Life is a marathon, not a sprint.

I used to think the lesson from the fable of the tortoise and the hare was ""slow and steady always wins."" Which makes sense because the tortoise whose is the underdog eventually wins.

I think the lesson from that fable is that constant consistency always wins. The hare could have very easily won the race if it had stayed on track from start to finish, however, it got distracted a lot of times. The tortoise, however, kept moving along consistently not caring about what was going on around it. Its only objective was to achieve the goal no matter its pace.

Constant consistency has become my personal mantra. I have realized that whatever goal I set or challenge I face can be broken down into small solvable tasks that can be solved one at a time. Even in my learning, I have observed that no matter how steep the learning curve is as long as I am consistent in it, I am able to understand the material.

I am of the belief that anybody can learn anything given the appropriate resources which are personalized and individualized.

For day 18, I took the ""How to Learn Math: For Students"" on the Stanford Online platform. 

I would like to state that I am a math major and so my opinions are clearly biased.

Here are a few things I learned:
1.""The ideas in the world are for everyone to enjoy."" The concept that only certain groups of people can be good at certain things is insane.

2. The brain is a muscle that can be trained to grow and so it is important to treat learning the way bodybuilders treat building their physical muscles which is with constant consistency. 

3. Most people develop an affinity or dislike of a subject or topic because of the experiences they had. 

4. Math is important. It is a skill that no matter what your career path is you can use.

The truth is I loaded up my earlier years in college and even though I pursued 2 majors and a minor, I planned and worked in such a way that allowed me to be able to graduate early. As a result, for my final year in college, I have most of my work done and so have a lot of free time on my hand. And instead of netflix and chilling, I am couseraing and exploring technology.

To be honest, this was not my favorite Google Cloud course and I have always expressed how much I appreciate Google Cloud courses. 

I didn't really learn anything new because most of the material in the course has been covered in other Google Cloud courses on Coursera. 

However, the Qwiklabs which is a great way to put what you learn into practice is still a genius idea and I got to play around more with the Google Cloud Platform after I finished my labs. This is probably the main reason I love Google Cloud courses on Coursera

This paper confirmed what I had always believed all along that at its core, programming is just understanding and implementing logic and much more than a memorization of leetcode and whiteboard questions.

I think machine learning wasn't as ubiquitous then as it is now because as Minksy dives into some question‑answering programs, one can see where ML could be applied in those situations.

I have always been fascinated by space but I loved this talk more because it detailed the implications of data in space exploratory research.

What I learned:

1. Even in the age of artificial intelligence and machine learning, machines can make mistakes.

2. The human brain is amazing at pattern recognition much better than machine currently.

3. If your data is wrong, your results will be wrong even if the process and hypothesis are right.

My undergraduate degree took way longer than I had anticipated.

Ninsiiah, my first foray into entrepreneurship which the paper I started in college failed horribly. 

But then I started to take inventory of all the places I have been whilst pursuing these goals, people I have met, knowledge and skills I have acquired and the person I am becoming, I am glad I pursued those goals, they made for one heck of a story to share one day.

In life, things don’t always go the way we plan. There are some people who work harder, are smarter, do everything right and still don’t meet their goals.
This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try or we shouldn’t set goals.

For day 13, I continued work on my Developing Applications with Google Cloud Platform specialization on Coursera with the Getting Started With Application Development course.

Since this course is a one week course, the rest of this week will be devoted to completing it. This will be my 4th Google Cloud Specialization on Coursera.

Even though I am still experimenting with the various online courses on cloud computing offered by the major providers, I keep coming back to GCP because:

1. They have adopted the Coursera model which I think is very effective for me. There are multiple dedicated course instructors who even though are probably reading from a teleprompter still, manage to create a classroom like setting online.

2. Access to GCP in its entirety is also offered for free via timed labs on Qwiklabs which is amazing because I get to put what I learn to practice.

3. I think the Cloud team on Coursera does a great job of explaining concepts like cloud technology, storage on the cloud, etc, effectively not only try to get you to use Google Cloud, but to allow you to port that knowledge to other platforms minus the APIs and platform-specific code.

For day 12, I finally completed the Problem Solving with Excel course by PwC on Coursera.

As a computer science student, I had a very narrow thought that Excel is a tool that only business students should focus on but after this course, I am actually blown away by the powerhouse that Excel is. In my own opinion, I think it might be one of the greatest software products ever made. I would love to see the source code, not to contribute to it but to see what the first team of developers thought when they were creating this masterpiece.

Here is what I learned:

1. It's very possible to do data analysis, from cleaning data to visualization, entirely in Excel. I know most people are aware of this but making interactive visualizations in Excel was very new to me.

2. I don't think anyone knows the extent of the full power of Excel, no matter how much you think you're good, there's always something that makes you go, ""wait, Excel can do that?""

3. It blows my mind how people in the financial industry were able to do meaningful work at scale on Spreadsheets without technology like Excel. They deserve a whole lot of applause.

I adore my favorite writers and intellectuals like Ralph Waldo Emerson, the same way some people adore sports players and celebrities.
For day 11, I reread his Essays on Self-reliance 

Here are a few of my favorite quotes:

1. “Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.”

2.  ""I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should. I must be myself.""

3. ""There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.""

4 “The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.” 

5. “God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.”

What I learned:

1. Coding is actually really fun. It seems like a chore when you treat it like a means to a good career or a way to become the next billionaire or world problem solver. 

2. I know some people only think of Python in terms of a Data Science, ML or AI sense but a careful investigation would show Python is actually a very thriving language in CS with a very active community that is probably rivalled only by the Linux community in my opinion.

3. Documentation is what separates good code from great code. Others should be able to read your code, use it and contribute meaningfully to it.

4. If you want to understand Object Oriented Programming really well, experiment with Python modules and try to see if you can contribute to a particular module or create one on your own.

I suck at interviewing. Even after I have prepared ceaselessly, read the required materials, performed informational interviews, and researched the company, there are times I still find myself wanting in the interview.

If you're like me, this course is for you. It addresses pre-interview, interview and post interview techniques that are extremely helpful.

What I learned:
1. The recruiting process is a grueling and expensive process and so if you make it to the interview stage, that means you have what it takes, you just have to show that to the interviewer.

2. Memorizing a list of answers don't really do much, you should know who you are and what value you bring and communicate that effectively than regurgitating answers you read off the internet.

3. Always ask carefully thought out and researched questions  that show an interest in the interviewer and the company at the end of the interview. This would allow the interviewer to see you working at that place.

Unfortunately, this course does not address specific technical interviews which are of a different format but I think the lessons from it can be applied in multiple roles.

One of the main reasons I love Python is the availability of various models that creatively solve problems that I don't have to build solutions from scratch for. However, I realized that for almost a year now I have only been using the same Python modules like hashtag#Numpy, hashtag#Pandas, hashtag#Matplotlib, hashtag#SciPy, hashtag#Scikit, hashtag#Tensorflow, hashtag#Plotly, hashtag#Pytorch and hashtag#Keras.

So for day 9, I ventured out to explore Python modules I haven't heard off before or used in a school or personal project or were simply fun to do. I hope to share the results of my experiments later but attached are some resources if you love python and want to just explore some fun and unusual modules.

Today, I got the amazing opportunity to sit down and chat with Chinenye Chukwuemeka who shared a similar experience about the early stages of her academic career in computer science, how she left and her triumphant return to it after a hectic start.

Hearing her journey, present actions and next steps encouraged me to be resilient in my own journey and that if at first I don't succeed then I try again, again and again.

Cognitive Class has labs that use IBM cloud, quizzes and timed exams. I can't believe I have never heard of this site before. It has A+ on content especially for college students looking to explore learning. There is also a compete section.

Also, the website was advertising free IBM cloud credits which is amazing.

Special shoutouts to Yos Vincenzo for sharing the Microsoft Learn platform (https://lnkd.in/eU7Kr6w).
For Day 6, I completed the introduction to Azure module, launched my first Azure VM and hosted a prototype website on my VM.

What I learned:
1. I learned how to engage with the Azure command line which allows the use of both Windows PowerShell and Linux Bash.

2. How to create an Azure VM and deploy a website on it.

My Qualms:
1. I think the courses emphasize the use of Azure for projects more than actually the understanding of cloud technology as a whole, which is totally fine. I think they made the course more for Azure adoption than for exploration of cloud technology.

2. I did a lot of copy and pasting of code and had to look at other resources to see what each of the lines meant.

If you are interested in learning and exploring the Microsoft ecosystem you should definitely check out:
The Microsoft Learn platform (https://lnkd.in/eU7Kr6w).

""You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself."" -- Ken Thompson

For Day 5 I completed the Introduction to Cyber Attacks course by New York University on Coursera.
I didn't start this course today but I technically got done with it today.

It is a great course to take if you're new to the world of Cybersecurity and what a basic understanding that is not too complex to follow.

What I found most useful:
1. The instructor provides practical applications for example he walks through a Typical Unix Kernel Attack that you can follow along in your Linux shell.

2. I found an understanding that simple problems don't always have simple solutions.

3. I came to the conclusion that a basic understanding of Cybersecurity is necessary for a complete computer science education, in addition to knowing data structures and algorithms.

4. Adversary types even the malicious ones can be resources to understand the weakness in structures.

Disadvantages:
The only disadvantage I found is that the course has made me very paranoid about every website, app and even compilers.

1. I missed out on the most important professional career opportunity.

Lessons: 
a. Sometimes you just have to take the risk and figure out the rest later. 
b.It’s okay to close gates but never burn bridges. 

2. I got rejected after 32 different tech interviews. I know, insane, right? This includes first rounds, second rounds, and final rounds.

Lessons: 
a. It is important that you know and are able to effectively communicate your worth otherwise no one will recognize your hard work or efforts.
b. After a rejection, give yourself time to cry, play “Thank you, next” and move on to the next goal.

3. I didn’t meet the necessary requirements for a particular course and took my first Incomplete in college.

Lessons: 
a. Communication is king, you should be able to communicate your ideas effectively to others.
b. Hard work doesn’t always pay, sometimes you have to apply street smarts even in academia.

4. I missed out on applying to amazing postgraduate programs in a timely manner.

Lessons: 
a. Worrying never solved anything.
b. Sometimes you make bad decisions when you’re anxious and, in a hurry, to accomplish things, so relax

If you're familiar with Tableau, or if you're working on more complex dashboards, this is a great course to polish up on your skills.

Most important things I learned in this course:
1. I always knew a blue pill is a dimension and a green pill is a measure. It turns out the blue pills are actually discrete data while green pills are continuous data and they affect visualization of data tremendously.

2. This course shows intricate ways to display geographical mapping of data and when its appropriate to use it or not.

3. You can actually create dashboards to fit various devices such mobile phones etc. 

4. There is a great community of Tableau users who have created various dashboards you can look at for inspiration and play around with.

5. Tableau can be an amazing presentation tool if utilized right.

Best thing about this course is the exercise files contain a lot of data (csv files included) that you can play with in Python or other data analysis tools.

Disadvantage:
The course focuses on version 10.2 which about 6 versions earlier than the latest version 2018.3

Physics and mathematics students would appreciate this.

I read a math paper on the ""Correspondence Between Geometric and Differential Definitions of the Sine and Cosine"" by Horia Petrache.

I have always known the geometric definition of the cosine and sine function but I never realized there was a differential definition and since differential equations is my favorite undergraduate course ever, I found the article really worthwhile.

1. Learning new things can be extremely difficult but finding inspiration helps a lot. I found mine in Tim Salau. His relentless pursuit of learning new things motivates me to keep learning. 

2. MOOCs get a lot of flak but I like them because I get to personalize my learning experience. Not only can one choose the topics they are interested in and the time to pursue them, but they can also experiment and modify the courses to suit their personal learning styles

3. Coursera has financial aid for most of the courses and I think college students who love learning should definitely take advantage of that feature.

His hashtag#agiledevelopment specialization is a one of a kind great resource for any persons or teams looking for a practical approach to the adoption of agile or interested in the software development or product release cycle.

The specialization addresses the intersection between design thinking and agile, managing agile teams, testing with agile, product design sprints and brings industry insights to an academic setting.

Alex keeps the material engaging with amazing course materials, entertaining skits, informative interviews with industry personnel. I particularly enjoyed challenging quizzes. I also noticed that the course has a more engaged community and you can receive feedback on peer assignments in a relatively fast manner.

I highly recommend this course 🔥🔥🔥

I had just finished my sophomore year of college and could barely regurgitate what I had learned in my CS classes. My bosses being the geniuses that they were, introduced me to analyzing data with Python because of my background in Python and that opened my eyes to the possibilities in computer science. 

The learning curve was steep but I was working on something really interesting to me. I found it awesome that few lines of code could manipulate columns of data and instead of using Excel which I was awful at, I could use hashtag#Python. I loved it so much that after my internship, I didn’t use regular IDEs anymore I only used hashtag#Jupyternotebooks.

Imagine my surprise when I finally decided to take Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera out of curiosity for what AI was and found out that the labs were in hashtag#Jupyternotebooks, with hashtag#Python, hashtag#Pandas, hashtag#Numpy and hashtag#Matplotlib. Even now, I am still applying what I learned that summer in Facebook's Udacity Pytorch challenge.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-acheampong/,Post,"Why do you want to be a technologist?

I was recently stumped by this question and that led to a series of self-reflection. At first, I thought money. But then I realized that there are so many other career options with similar financial benefits. Then I thought viable career option, but I was raised to see dignity in all labor and to work hard so no matter what job I end up doing I will be fine. Then I thought maybe prestige but that did not explain why I have watched every single Google IO, Apple WWDC, September event, IGN conference or read Wired and The Verge daily or even why I follow numerous tech bloggers religiously and have a Google alert for technology news. Then I thought maybe because I am good at it but the numerous failed technical interviews and Hackerrank challenges would beg to differ.


Why do I want to be a technologist?

I will never forget the moment I turned the first PC I built on, and it worked. I want to be a technologist because more than anything I enjoy building things. If I had one wish it would be the opportunity to file at least 100 patents at the end of my career. I also want to be a technologist because I never want to stop learning and there is always more to learn in technology.

I view an understanding of computer science not just as a career path which is usually the case for most, but as skill in the toolbox of skills you acquire on your educational journey. The same way you learned how addition and multiplication work without needing to win a Nobel Prize in mathematics, you can learn the basics of computer science without wanting to be the next tech billionaire or even work for a tech company.

For my final year of college, I have been exploring various technologies which I know I might have difficulty exploring when adulthood finally catches up with me after graduation. I have recently been intrigued by hashtag#quantumcomputing and been reading and watching a lot of course materials on it. Unfortunately, most of the materials are heavily focused on research and academia. However, I am more interested in its current and future industry applications and how it might change the landscape of computing in the workplace.

Therefore, if anyone could suggest resources like people I can follow, books, courses, articles, videos, podcasts, etc that address the industrial application of quantum computing, I would greatly appreciate it.

Jones is a great resource for anyone who is learning the Python programming language, doing online coding challenges in Python, working on projects in Python needing recipe code to solve complex problems or anyone who is just enjoys coding (because Python is arguably becoming the most popular fastest programming language). 

It covers, Data Structures and Algorithms,
Strings and Text, Numbers, Dates, and Times, Iterators and Generators, Files and I/O, Data Encoding and Processing, Functions
Classes and Objects, Metaprogramming, Modules and Packages, Network and Web Programming, Concurrency, Utility Scripting and System Administration, Testing, Debugging, Exceptions, and C Extensions.

I particularly like it because it discusses how and why the recipes work, contains practice exercises but most importantly addresses a wide range of problems in one book without a need for multiple StackOverflow tabs.

NB: It's mostly based on Python 3.3

Lisa Barrington wrote a very intriguing article on Forbes online, “Everyone Needs A Personal Board of Directors.” I disagreed with the notion at first but as I continued reading the article, I realized she was emphasizing the importance of building relationships and mentorship in both life and career. It brought to mind my favorite Maya Angelou quote of all time, “I go forth along, and stand as ten thousand.”

Being a self-described socially awkward person, I find reaching out to people a bit unnerving. Yet, I have been blessed and fortunate enough to encounter some of the most incredible people who have selflessly contributed immensely to my personal and professional growth.

I became concerned, because I had this narrow minded view that this is the one class that is supposed to be the determinant of success in a career in software engineering, and that every “technical” interview was going to test my understanding of computer science basics and “problem-solving” skills with questions from this class and I since didn’t do well in it, a career in technology was no place for me.

Peter Bakhirev changed that perception. He introduced me to Jupyter notebooks, Python modules for data analytics, and most importantly, showed me that technology is a spectrum and not a one size fits all. Just because I didn’t have every solution in the “Cracking the Coding Interview” or couldn’t write an algorithm to reverse a binary tree in 10 minutes or less on paper or couldn’t pass every test case in a Hackerrank challenge doesn’t mean I can’t be a technologist.

I enjoyed using Jupyter notebooks so much that, I still code in Jupyter notebooks.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-acheampong/,Post,"In defense of Massive Open Online Courses.

I have been reading a lot on both sides of the arguments on the significance of online educational certifications. Both schools of thoughts present valid points. For example, I don't want to receive health care from someone who took a 6-month online course on medicine. However, the formal educational system as a whole is in dire need of disruption as the way things have always been done has not traditionally been very inclusive to a lot of people.

I believe the value of Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) is that they seek to bridge the gap of inequality created by formal structural education which might be too expensive and impersonal for some. MOOCs takes advantage of technology to provide affordable, personalized and accessible education at scale. The key point here is ""AT SCALE"". With the explosion of information, more and more people are increasingly being in need of quality education and it is evident that structural education cannot keep up with that need.

 I am very vocal about my love for Coursera, one of the major MOOC platforms available, because it has allowed me to take control of my own learning and has given me a passion to keep learning.",18,1,5mo,2019-03-09T15:57:51.899Z,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6450603520142950401

I wondered why after I had done all the research, followed every advice I could garner, networked,  spent countless hours checking and rechecking my applications and custom tailoring my responses, I was still being rejected. Why not me?

What was particularly difficult for me was that I always had my own definition and metrics of success which did not particularly conform to the standardized timeline and approved aspirations of others. Yet, I used to feel I was being left behind and not enough.

However, now, I have come to the realization that everybody deserves success on some level. Someone filled or will fill the job I have been rejected from. The scholarship money I didn't receive, made someone very happy and proud. The interview I failed helped someone to get their dream job. The person who ignored my request and messages had important business to take care of.

NB: I am in no way an expert on the topic. I am just curious and the resources have guided my exploration to hashtag#alwaysbelearning.

All the MOOC are on Coursera because the content they provide is top notch by experts from academia and industry and it provides financial aid (all my courses have been fully funded)

1. hashtag#MachineLearning with hashtag#Tensorflow on hashtag#GoogleCloud Specialization by Google
Valliappa Lakshmanan and his team of instructors do an amazing job of explaining what hashtag#MachineLearning is, why it’s important and how to utilize Google’s resources to engage with it.

2. hashtag#Mathematics for hashtag#MachineLearning Specialization by Imperial College London.
This covers all the hashtag#linearalgebra, hashtag#calculus, hashtag#differentialequations, that you will need to understand hashtag#machinearning. It provides content for people who much experience with hashtag#mathematics and those who are not very mathematically inclined.

No matter how many times you experience it, it still stings. Even a thick skin has a mushy hypodermis. Truth is, you can give your all, obey every rule, meet every requirement and do everything you could possibly do right, and still fail. 

As a child I used to believe Ananse stories, “Toli O Toli” and that success was directly correlated with hard work. Then I grew up.

There are books, articles, and videos about how some people achieved success but I have come to believe that not every startup founder is going to be the next Zuckerberg. Not every smart student who applies will get into Harvard, not every talented professional is going to be employed by their dream company and not everyone achieves their dreams even after 1000 tries.

However, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. They say aim for the stars, if you miss at least you might land on the moon. But what they forget to mention is that you could quite possibly be stranded in space but that would still be one heck of a story to tell.

I recently decided to explore hashtag#finance. My skewed ideas of finance professionals did not quite prepare me for how analytical finance was. What surprised me the most was that I was actually able to follow along and soon began building hashtag#dcf models due to how strong my background in hashtag#mathematics was.

Even though I am studying hashtag#mathematics now, I hated hashtag#mathematics in high school. I was not really good at it and I used to think I was never going to apply hashtag#pythagorastheorem or hashtag#cauchyschwarzproof or other countless theorems and proofs in any real life situation.

Unbeknownst to me, my mathematical studies built in me analytical thinking, persistence through difficult challenge and most importantly it allowed me to see that there is so much I don’t know.

I acknowledge that the study of hashtag#mathematics can be intellectually challenging which overwhelms some and builds upon previous knowledge and so having a good foundation is ideal. However, I think it’s time to disintegrate the elitist mentality surrounding the study of mathematics that only makes it attractive to certain personality and learning types. hashtag#Mathematics builds more than technical skills and I believe every career trajectory can benefit from an understanding of hashtag#mathematics.",34,0,7mo,2019-03-09T15:57:51.901Z,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6429435720770813952

As a sophomore in college, I had no idea where to begin in my internship pursuit. I don’t go to a target school so there were no opportunities on campus to interact with recruiters. I didn’t have the chance to go to a tech conference and everywhere I applied rejected me.

Per adventure, I came across Scouted on scouted.io. I had nothing to lose and so I applied. Surprisingly, they got back to me. They saw me to be more than the school I went to and a GPA figure and gave me a shot by opening me to opportunities where no one else would.

I used to believe that being smart is a talent that a person had or didn’t have. That changed when as a teenager, although my school grades weren’t impeccable, I was able to answer a question about the Trojan war because I had read Homer which was not part of our curriculum.

From then on my mentality became “if I learn, I will know”

I came across hashtag#highfrequencytrading when reading Michael Lewis’  hashtag#flashboys. I became intrigued and started learning about the technology of hashtag#fiberopticcables and realized I could understand the physics of it after spending time on it.

More recently, with my introduction to hashtag#machinelearning and hashtag#deeplearning, I was a bit hesitant to try and engage with it at first but I was quite surprised to realize that my experiences with hashtag#differentialequations, hashtag#linearalgebra, hashtag#Jupyter, hashtag#Python, hashtag#pandas, and hashtag#numpy, had adequately prepared me to learn and participate in it.

As dictated by hashtag#ParetosPrinciple only about 20% engaged with me and one of them was Marcellus Pelcher. He gave me a lot of insights and eventually introduced me to an algorithm course Coursera which ignited my desire to learn even more.

Dear Coursera,

What's good? I just want to take the time to express how much you mean to me. Before college, I was a voracious reader. I read everything I could lay my hands on, from first edition essays by Ralph Waldo Emmerson to all Harry Potter books and even Principia Mathematica. However, college happened.

In the midst of being occupied with getting good grades, networking and thinking about my future career, I neglected my love of learning. I only read for my courses and became so obsessed with the idea of a career that I lost my love of exploring the unknown or better put, things not directly related to my career.

That’s where you come in. Since I became acquainted with you, I have explored machine learning, finance, IT, economics and even philosophy. Your collaborations with various colleges, professors like Andrew Ng, and companies like Google, IBM, Goldman Sachs, among others have created content that is actually impacting lives. Without the fear of a bad grade, I have been able to rediscover my love of learning and you have awakened the inquisitive mind I had growing up and made me very happy these past few months.
